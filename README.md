# GIS5577 Week 5
**Class materials for week 5**

This week we will begin working with spatial data inside **PostgreSQL**!
The powerpoint will provide detailed instructions for connecting to a server to load data. Additionally, it is always helpful to load the data into GIS for visualization purposes.

After this lecture you should practice on your own loading datasets into the database.
* Using the command line
* Using the shp2pg_gui
