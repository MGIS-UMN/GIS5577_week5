# GIS5577 Week 5
**Class materials for week 5**

This week we will begin working with spatial data inside **PostgreSQL**!
The powerpoint will provide detailed instructions for connecting to a server to load data. Additionally, it is always helpful to load the data into GIS for visualization purposes.
